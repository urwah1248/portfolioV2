            Greetings, my name is Urwah, and I possess a profound passion
            for crafting digital experiences on the internet. Even in my early years,
            I harbored a curiosity about the inner workings of software and game
            development, driving me to pursue the art of creating them myself. 
            This curiosity materialized as my very first coding endeavorâ€”a blogger blogspot.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I am pursuing a software engineering degree at Sindh Madressatul Islam
            University. My primary objective at present is to maintain a steadfast commitment
            to continual learning and honing my skills in website and application development.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Here are few of the technologies that I frequently work with:</p>
